# ðŸŽµ **MuseReccs** 

MuseReccs is a Discord Music Bot with dynamic playlist management, queue systems, and a sentiment-based recommendation system utilizing a VaderSentiment NLP model and the Spotify API to safely analyze your recent relevant messages and give song recommendations based on your current mood!
Have the bot join the call at will and queue any song you wish. The sky's the limit for how many songs you want to have in line! You can also create and add playlists at free will with no limitations, and play a given playlist when you'd like.
If you want to get song recommendations based on your current mood, use the *.recommend* command! This feature is still in development, but will be finished soon.

Use the *.help* command for a easy-to-read guide on how to use all bot features and commands.
